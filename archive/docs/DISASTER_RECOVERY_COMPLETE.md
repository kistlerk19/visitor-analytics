# Complete Disaster Recovery Implementation

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**
- ✅ **Primary Region**: Full ECS cluster with 2 running tasks
- ✅ **DR Region**: Pilot light ECS cluster (0 tasks, ready to scale)
- ✅ **Auto-scaling**: Configured for 1-6 tasks based on demand
- ✅ **Task Definitions**: Version-controlled and replicated across regions

#### 2. **RDS (Relational Database Service)**
- ✅ **Primary Database**: MySQL 8.0 on db.t3.micro with 7-day backup retention
- ✅ **Cross-Region Read Replica**: Real-time replication to DR region
- ✅ **Automated Promotion**: Lambda-based replica promotion during failover
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Replication lag monitoring and alerts

#### 3. **S3 (Static Assets & Backups)**
- ✅ **Cross-Region Replication**: Automatic replication of all assets
- ✅ **Versioning**: Enabled on both primary and DR buckets
- ✅ **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic transition to Glacier after 30 days
- ✅ **Encryption**: Server-side encryption enabled

#### 4. **Lambda Functions**
- ✅ **DR Automation**: Automated failover orchestration
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks every 5 minutes
- ✅ **Alert System**: SNS notifications for health issues
- ✅ **Cross-Region Deployment**: Functions deployed in both regions

#### 5. **Networking & Load Balancing**
- ✅ **VPC Setup**: Mirrored VPC configuration in DR region
- ✅ **Application Load Balancer**: Pre-created ALB in DR region
- ✅ **Security Groups**: Identical security configurations
- ✅ **Route 53**: DNS failover routing (optional)

## 🚨 Disaster Recovery Process

### Automated Failover (RTO: 5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Trigger automated failover
./disaster-recovery/scripts/automated-failover.sh
```

**Process Steps:**
1. **Health Check**: Verify primary region status
2. **Lambda Trigger**: Invoke DR automation function
3. **RDS Promotion**: Promote read replica to primary
4. **ECS Scale-Up**: Scale DR region from 0 to 2 tasks
5. **Health Verification**: Confirm DR region health
6. **Notification**: Send success/failure alerts

### Manual Failover (Alternative)

```bash
# Traditional manual failover
./disaster-recovery/scripts/failover.sh
```

### Failback Process

```bash
# Return to primary region
./disaster-recovery/scripts/failback.sh
```

## 📋 Maintenance & Monitoring

### Regular DR Testing

```bash
# Non-destructive DR testing
./disaster-recovery/scripts/test-dr.sh
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Primary region health checks
- DR region infrastructure validation
- Database replication verification
- Lambda function testing
- S3 cross-region replication
- End-to-end application testing

### Monitoring Components

#### CloudWatch Alarms
- ECS service health
- RDS replication lag
- Application response times
- Lambda function errors

#### SNS Notifications
- Health check failures
- DR activation events
- Infrastructure alerts
- Test results

#### Route 53 Health Checks
- Primary ALB monitoring
- Automatic DNS failover
- Global health status

## 🔧 Implementation Guide

### 1. Enable DR Infrastructure

```bash
# Set GitHub Actions variable
ENABLE_DR = "true"

# Or manually enable
cd disaster-recovery
terraform apply -var="enable_dr=true"
```

### 2. Configure DNS (Optional)

```bash
# Add domain to terraform.tfvars
domain_name = "your-domain.com"
```

### 3. Test DR Setup

```bash
# Run comprehensive DR test
./disaster-recovery/scripts/test-dr.sh
```

### 4. Schedule Regular Testing

Add to crontab for monthly DR testing:
```bash
0 2 1 * * /path/to/disaster-recovery/scripts/test-dr.sh >> /var/log/dr-test.log 2>&1
```

## 📊 Recovery Metrics

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **Automated**: 5-10 minutes
- **Manual**: 10-15 minutes
- **DNS Propagation**: Additional 5-60 minutes

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **Database**: Near real-time (< 1 minute lag)
- **Static Assets**: Real-time replication
- **Application State**: Stateless (no data loss)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Private subnets for all compute resources
- Security groups with minimal required access
- VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Encrypted data in transit and at rest

### Access Control
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Cross-region IAM role assumptions
- Secrets Manager for credential management
- Lambda execution roles with specific permissions

### Compliance
